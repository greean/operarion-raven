### Python and Django Group Project

Initially a 3 day project using Python and Django, this site was developed in collaboration with 3 other Junior Developers. The site has since been deployed using Heroku.
Below is the brief and requirements for the project.

## Operation Raven: Eyes On The Sky

## UFO's

Irrespective of ones personal opinion, for as long as human kind has been staring at the stars they have seen something unexplained.

The public has for decades reported these sightings to their respective governments.

The UK government has declassified sightings and made them available for the public.

## Task

While this information has been collected in a spread sheet and is available in the archives, a more full featured database is now required.

Your development team will concern itself with designing and developing a system for listing UFO sighting events. 

## Requirements

* A page listing all events
* A page that shows an individual event
* A page that lists all locations
* A page that lists all events for a given location
* A page that lists all events for a given date
